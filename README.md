# SafeTimer
SafeTimer is a prototype system helps to prevent false timeout detection which might be caused by heartbeat delay/drop on receiver and sender side.

Full details of SafeTimer are available in our paper, [Accurate Timeout Detection Despite
Arbitrary Processing Delays](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc18/atc18-ma-sixiang.pdf), USENIX ATC 2018.

Slides describe the fundamental ideas of SafeTimer are avilable, [pdf](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/atc18_slides_ma.pdf).

### Building
The document about how to build and use SafeTimer will be accomplished shortly.
